  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> August 30, 2025</p>

  <p><strong>Braapster</strong> (“we,” “our,” or “us”) respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use the Braapster mobile application (“App”).</p>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>We do <strong>not collect, store, or share any personal information</strong> when you use the App. The App does not require you to create an account or provide personal data.</p>

  <h2>Location Information</h2>
  <p>
    The App may request access to your device’s location to calculate the distance between your current location and an event.
    Location information is used <strong>only while the App is running</strong> to provide this feature and is <strong>not stored, shared, or transmitted</strong> to us or to any third party.
  </p>

  <h2>Information Stored Locally</h2>
  <p>
    The App allows you to mark certain events as favorites. These favorites are stored only on your device to make them easy for you to find later.
    This information is not transmitted to us or to any third party and is removed if you uninstall the App or clear the App’s data.
  </p>

  <h2>Sharing Events</h2>
  <p>
    The App allows you to share event details with others by using the sharing features built into iOS and Android.
    When you choose to share, the App generates a simple text version of the event and passes it to the system share sheet.
    We do not collect or transmit this information; sharing is handled entirely by your device’s operating system and the apps you select.
  </p>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Google Sheets API (Read-Only).</strong> The App uses the Google Sheets API in a <strong>read-only</strong> manner to retrieve event data from sheets we maintain. The App does not write to any sheet, upload user data, or require user authentication with Google.</li>
    <li><strong>Launching Google Maps.</strong> The App can launch Google Maps (for example, to open directions) but does not embed or integrate the Google Maps SDK. Your use of Google Maps is governed by Google’s <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>Platform Analytics.</strong> Apple and Google may collect basic platform-level analytics (e.g., installs, crashes, general usage) through their operating systems or app stores. We do not control or access that data.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Links to External Websites</h2>
  <p>
    The App may provide links to external event or venue websites.
    These websites are not operated or controlled by us, and their content and privacy practices are governed by their own policies.
    We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any external sites you visit.
  </p>

  <h2>Contacting Venues</h2>
  <p>
    The App may provide options to contact event venues directly, such as launching your device’s email app to send an email or the phone app to make a call.
    These actions are handled entirely by your device and the apps you choose. We do not collect, store, or transmit any email addresses, phone numbers, or communication content.
  </p>

  <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>The App does not knowingly collect information from children under 13. If you believe a child has provided us information, please contact us and we will address it promptly.</p>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Updates will be posted here with a new effective date.</p>
